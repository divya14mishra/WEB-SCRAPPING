However, if two routes are received and they both have the same AD, then the router will choose the one route with the lowest metrics, or in RIP's case, hop count. "
Cse Engineering,IP Routing, ,You type debug ip rip on your router console and see that 172.16.10.0 is being advertised to you with a metric of 16. What does this mean?,The route is 16 hops away.,The route has a delay of 16 microseconds.,The route is inaccessible.,The route is queued at 16 messages a second., ,C," You cannot have 16 hops on a RIP network by default. If you receive a route advertised with a metric of 16, this means it is inaccessible. "

Cse Engineering,IP Routing, ,A network administrator views the output from the show ip route command. A network that is advertised by both RIP and IGRP appears in the routing table flagged as an IGRP route. Why is the RIP route to this network not used in the routing table?,IGRP has a faster update timer.,IGRP has a lower administrative distance.,RIP has a higher metric value for that route.,The IGRP route has fewer hops., ,B," RIP has an administrative distance (AD) of 120, while IGRP has an administrative distance of 100, so the router will discard any route with a higher AD than 100.

CIDR  Split horizon  Authentication  Classless masking  Holddown timers,1 and 3,"2, 3 and 5",2 and 5,3 and 4, ,C, RIPv2 uses the same timers and loop-avoidance schemes as RIPv1. Split horizon is used to stop an update from being sent out the same interface it was received on. Holddown timers allow time for a network to become stable in the case of a flapping link. 
Cse Engineering,IP Routing, ,Which two of the following are true regarding the distance-vector and link-state routing protocols?  Link state sends its complete routing table out all active interfaces on periodic time intervals.

First, you can set a default route with the <i class=""networking-code"">0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0</i> mask and then specify the next hop, as in option A. Or you can use <i class=""networking-code"">0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0</i> and use the exit interface instead of the next hop. Finally, you can use option D with the <i class=""networking-code"">ip default-network</i> command. "

Cse Engineering,Spanning Tree Protocol, ,"If you want to disable STP on a port connected to a server, which command would you use?",disable spanning-tree,spanning-tree off,spanning-tree security,spanning-tree portfast, ,D," If you have a server or other devices connected into your switch that you're totally sure won't create a switching loop if STP is disabled, you can use something called <i class=""networking-code"">portfast</i> on these ports. Using it means the port won't spend the usual 50 seconds to come up while STP is converging. "

What could this indicate?,The port is experiencing errors.,The port is shut down.,The port is in STP blocking mode.,"Nothing, this is normal.", ,A," When you connect to a switch port, at first the link lights are orange/amber, and then they turn green, indicating normal operation. If the link light is blinking, you have a problem. "

When filtering to an upper-layer protocol, you must use an extended list, numbers 100-199 and 2000-2699. Also, when you filter to an upper-layer protocol, you must use either <i class=""networking-code"">tcp</i> or <i class=""networking-code"">udp</i> in the protocol field.
